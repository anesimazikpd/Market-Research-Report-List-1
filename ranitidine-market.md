<p><strong>What Are The Key Opportunities For Ranitidine Manufacturers?</strong></p>
<p><p>The Ranitidine market has witnessed significant changes, particularly following the product's withdrawal due to safety concerns regarding potential carcinogenic impurities. Prior to this, the market experienced steady growth driven by the increasing prevalence of acid-related disorders.
