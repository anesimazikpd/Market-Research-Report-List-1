<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Receiver Multicoupler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Multicouplers</li><li>Active Multicouplers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Receiver multicouplers are essential devices that enable multiple receivers to simultaneously access signals from a single antenna. The market for these devices can be categorized into two main types: passive multicouplers and active multicouplers. Passive multicouplers distribute signals without amplification, relying solely on passive components to split the signal. In contrast, active multicouplers utilize amplifiers to boost signal strength before distribution, making them suitable for long-distance applications where signal loss is a concern. Both types serve critical roles in communications and broadcasting systems.</p></p>
