<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Panel Detector Digital Radiography Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect FPD</li><li>Direct FPD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Flat Panel Detector (FPD) Digital Radiography market is divided into two main types: Indirect FPD and Direct FPD. Indirect FPD utilizes a two-step process where X-rays are first converted to light and then detected by a sensor, providing high image quality but with potential delays in processing. In contrast, Direct FPD captures X-rays directly into electrical signals, offering faster image acquisition and enhanced spatial resolution, making it ideal for dynamic imaging. Both types cater to varying clinical needs and technological advancements.</p></p>
